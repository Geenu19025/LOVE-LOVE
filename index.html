            <p>Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
                You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)<br>
                Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)<br>
                You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)<br>
                And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)<br>
                Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)<br>
                "We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)<br>
                Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)<br>
                My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)<br>
